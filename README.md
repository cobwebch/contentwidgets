# TYPO3 Extension: content widgets

This extension makes it possible to load content inside a TYPO3 CMS page using an AJAX call.
Either a TypoScript library or a selection of content elements may be loaded in such a way.

## Installation

After installing the extension, you also need to load the provided static template.
This static template will in turn load the required JS file.

> NOTE: The static template assumes that your base page object is called `PAGE`.

## Requirements

This extension assumes that jQuery is used as a JavaScript framework.
